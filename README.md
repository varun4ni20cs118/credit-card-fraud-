<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains code and resources for a credit card fraud detection project using data science techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data used in this project is sourced from [provide source or dataset name]. It consists of a large number of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)</li>
  <li>Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<code>git  https://github.com/varun4ni20cs118/credit-card-fraud-.git</code>

</ol>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>data/</code>: Contains the dataset used in the project.</li>
  <li><code>credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.</li>
  <li><code>requirements.txt</code>: List of required Python libraries for easy installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The machine learning model achieved [insert accuracy/precision/recall scores here] on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Possible future improvements for this project include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature engineering to improve model performance.</li>
  <li>Trying different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.</li>
  <li>Deploying the model as a web service for real-time fraud detection.</li>
</ul>
